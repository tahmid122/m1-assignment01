              "I stand in this parliament of nations thanks to an epochal
              transformation that Bangladesh witnessed this July and August. The
              'power of the ordinary people', in particular our youth, presented
              to our nation an opportunity to overhaul many of our systems and
              institutions. I pay the deepest respect to all those who died in
              the student-people revolution against fascism in July and August.
              May their souls rest in peace."
